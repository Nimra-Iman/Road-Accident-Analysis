# Road Accident Dashboard

This project is a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to road accidents, providing insights into accident severity, casualty distribution, and other factors influencing road safety. The dashboard aims to help stakeholders analyze accident data and make informed decisions to improve safety measures.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Primary KPIs
- Total Casualtie
- Total Casualties with Percentage
- Casualties by Vehicle Type
### Secondary KPIs
- Casualties by Vehicle Type

## Dashboard Features

- Monthly Trend Comparison: Comparison of total casualties per month for the current year versus the previous year, providing insights into accident trends over time.
- Casualties by Road Type: Visualization of maximum casualties based on road types (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway).
- Road Surface Distribution: Analysis of casualties by road surface condition (e.g., dry, wet, snowy).
- Area and Time Distribution: Breakdown of casualties by area (rural or urban) and time (day/night) to identify high-risk periods and locations.

## Visualizations

- **Casualties by Severity**: Total number of fatalities, serious injuries, and slight injuries.
- **Vehicle Type Distribution**: Number of casualties associated with different types of vehicles (e.g., cars, motorcycles, buses, tractors).
- **Casualties by Month**: Monthly comparison chart to track accident trends across two years.
- **Casualties by Road Type and Surface**: Bar and tree map visualizations to understand the impact of road type and surface conditions on casualty rates.
- **Area and Day/Night Analysis**: Pie charts showing the distribution of accidents by area (urban vs. rural) and time of day (daylight vs. darkness).

## Filter Panel

The dashboard includes a filter panel to dynamically view data by various factors:
- **Accident Date**: Filter by specific quarters or years.
- **Urban/Rural**: Filter data to focus on urban or rural accidents.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Filter Selection**: Use the filter panel to narrow down data based on accident date, area, and other factors.
2. **Analyze Trends**: Review monthly trends and year-over-year comparisons to understand patterns in accident data.
3. **Identify High-Risk Areas**: Focus on specific road types, areas, and times to identify high-risk situations and possible preventive measures.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and dashboard creation.


The Road Accident Dashboard provides critical insights into accident trends, enabling better understanding and decision-making to improve road safety. By analyzing various factors contributing to accidents, stakeholders can identify targeted interventions to reduce casualties and enhance overall road safety.
